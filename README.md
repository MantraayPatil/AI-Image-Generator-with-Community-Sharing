# My Project

## TLDR 
This project was designed to help me learn and become proficient with the MERN stack, including MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The website utilizes DALL-E’s AI model to generate images, which are presented through a clean and practical interface. It functions similarly to Pinterest, allowing users to save and share the generated images they like, as well as view and download images for themselves. Additionally, Tailwind CSS is used for a modern, responsive design, and Cloudinary is employed for efficient media management. This repository showcases my journey and growth in these technologies.


## Overview

This project is built using the MERN stack with additional integrations for image generation and media management. It features:

- A website that uses OpenAI’s DALL-E model for generating images.
- A user-friendly interface similar to Pinterest, allowing users to save, share, view, and download images.

## Technologies Used

- **MERN Stack:** MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js
